# Variables in Rust

## Overview
Learn about variable declaration, mutability, and shadowing in Rust. Understand Rust's approach to memory safety through its variable system.

## Key Concepts
- Variable declaration with `let`
- Mutability with `mut`
- Variable shadowing
- Constants with `const`
- Static variables

## Learning Objectives
- Declare variables in Rust
- Understand the difference between mutable and immutable variables
- Use variable shadowing effectively
- Work with constants and static variables

## Common Patterns
```rust
// Immutable variable
let x = 5;

// Mutable variable
let mut y = 10;
y = 15;

// Variable shadowing
let z = 5;
let z = z + 1;
let z = z * 2;

// Constants
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;

// Static variables
static HELLO_WORLD: &str = "Hello, world!";
```

## Best Practices
- Prefer immutable variables by default
- Use `mut` only when you need to modify the variable
- Use descriptive variable names
- Use constants for values that won't change throughout the program
- Use shadowing to transform values while keeping the same name

## Common Mistakes
- Forgetting to use `mut` when trying to modify a variable
- Confusing shadowing with mutation
- Using `mut` unnecessarily
